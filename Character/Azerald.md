*Figure out if proper notation*
### Background 
Raised in Cycad by a single mother and 2 other siblings, slowly they realized he was unique. Throughout his childhood he sporadically shot ice due to a lack of control. At the age of 14, his mother sent him off to the peaks of the Divine Mountains using the Cliff Track to receive proper training to utilize his magic to its fullest potential. Master *Insert Name Later* pushed Azerald to his limits in order to unlock his inner power. Reversing the prior knowledge of suppressing his magical abilities had taken time but once he discovered his origins it came almost natural. 

Prior to living in Cycad he was born in the Divine Mountains from a powerful Ice Dragon and his mother in Cycad. An unusual relationship and questionable breeding methods had led to his creation. While inheriting most of his mother's more elf-like traits, Azerald had inherited the ice qualities from his father and possibly the ability of flight...  something he has yet to discover

Master *Insert Name Later* once realizing what an unusual individual he had on his hands stepped up the training routine. He had trained Azerald heavily in military strategies and critical thinking under high stress situations. Azerald had begun to develop unique abilities seen in no other ice user. The ability to create ice under his feet allows him to glide through the terrain with unmatched speed and swagger. His most powerful ability arguably is his high velocity icicles. Shooting at a top speed of 45 m/s *Probably lower 100mph is a bit too fast tbh* he can penetrate the strongest of armors and maim his enemies. Other less special abilities involve creating walls of ice to shield from oncoming projectiles.
