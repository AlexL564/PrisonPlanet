## Enchanted Boats
The elves of Cycad are known for their creation of enchanted boats. 
### Description
Similar to the Trolly system in the real world these boats rely on magic wires to propel them across the river 
Powered by two magic reservoirs (on either side) the boat can travel a distance of 300 miles. 
This range can be extended infinitely through the use of more reservoirs 
### Use Cases 
The only fully established enchanted boat system is the Trans Redoak-Twightiten Express "TRTE" connecting Cycad to Twightiten through the *Ocean(insert name later)* 
There are stops at Mosses, *Shamainia(unsure)* and *Twightiten(ask name of Town)*
