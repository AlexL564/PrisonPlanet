### Business District 
The business district is the home of all shops, restaurants, offices, and entertainment in Cycad. Any transaction of money is done in this district.

#### Funicular 
At the edge of the Business District is the key of Cycad the funicular. The station runs all day and all night pushing 1000s of riders everyday. This is the second highest revenue source of the government behind taxes. As the sole provider of transportation of goods or people they are able to freely set the price to *Something high but not too high I still need to figure out econ*. Next to the funicular is a very large elevator exclusively for carrying large goods up and down 
##### Below the Funicular 
At the bottom of the Funicular there is a dock around 30 feet above the water. This pier is a hub for unloading cargo ships as well as water based businesses.

Cycad being home to the Continent's largest pier makes it almost a city within itself being about a 1 hour walk from one side to the other. The pier contains everything from souvenir shops to seafood restaurants , to carnival rides. 
##### Cliff Track
Straight in front of the funicular you can hop right onto the cliff track allowing you to go to mosses and Twightiten and back.
### Housing District 
on the further inland half of Cycad there is the housing district. The top elite members of society all live in a neighborhood along the only road to the business district allowing easier access in and out. They all have 10 acre or more lots with very well maintained yards and 3000 sq feet homes. Surrounding and further *figure out cardinal direction away from pier later* the peasants live. The peasants consist of medium and not so well of families looked down upon by elites. *expand upon*
