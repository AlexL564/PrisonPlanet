## People
### Social Hierarchy 
Cycad is split off into 3 general social classes of elves and druids alike. 
#### Elites *make fun name later*
The elites were 80% of the time born into this class. At the founding of Cycad the main colonizers were granted large plots of land to sell off and use as farmland(similar to Encomienda system from Spanish conquistadors). Later on as the population grew they were forced to sell the majority of their land. They could keep at most 30 acres but then split off the rest into 1/4 - 2 acre lots for the housing for everyone else. The remaining 20% of elites were self-made purely based on raw craftsmanship. Only the most skilled of craftsmen in Cycad made their way up to being elites often taking multiple generations. The elites made up 16% of the population roughly 50 people.
#### Middle-Class *make fun name later*
Similar to the real world 50% of the population is part of the middle class. Their jobs included franchise owners', managers of successful shops, bankers, and less-skilled artisans. In society they are generally respected by everyone for the effort they put into maintain financial security. 

#### The poor *make fun name later*
The remaining members of society are either unemployed or work very low/ no skill jobs.
